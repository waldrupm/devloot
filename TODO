  ☐ Contribute Page
  ☐ Profile page @defer
  ☐ Change star rating everywhere to list main tag, this will help contributors stay encouraged. Ratings are better left on a platform that sells things for money.
  ☐ Add donate section to individual asset pages
  ☐ Remove Contributor packs section and links as future feature, not on initial release.
  ☐ Remove download icon from all search / browse / index components. I don't want people spam downloading everything just because it's easy. Have to keep costs in mind.
  ☐ When someone is contributing, make sure they're aware the assets will also be hosted on github for easy downloading.
  ☐ Asset types - 3d 2d add-ons rigged models essentials GUI templates sounds Tools VFX
  ☐ Filter functionality in AlpineJS
  ☐ Figure out licensing
  ☐ Change folder icon to heart icon in all pages. We want favoriting and returning, not hoarding.
